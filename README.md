# licorice-pizza
Not-so-sweet implementations of embedding search, accompanied by boilerplate UI.

TODOS (some ongoing):    
- [x] setup envs for helpers.py in backend.   
- [x] connect routes with helpers.py for FastAPI.   
- [x] test routes via POSTMAN/httpie.   
- [ ] connect frontend with FastAPI host.
- [ ] add card layout to frontend for search
- [ ] try glass/saas-ui theme for chakra
- [ ] e2e test for workflow (w/o auth implemented).   
- [ ] add firebase admin to backend and frontend.
